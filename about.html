    <p style="margin-left: 23px">I got the idea for this when I was putting my schedule into my school schedule on my phone.
I realized that I was able to write a program that could do this for me.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 23px">Hopefully this saves a lot of people time from tedious schedule making!</p>
