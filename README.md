# UCDschedule--Gcalendar
Easily insert your school schedule into Google Calendar

Copy text from Schedule Builder, paste into this webpage. Insert the ID of the calendar you wish to use.
This program will create your schedule, including finals!

Originally written out in Python. Translated to Javascript and PHP to put it into a webpage.

I got the idea for this when I was putting my schedule into my calendar on my phone at the beginning of the Fall 2016 quarter.
I realized that I was able to write a script that could do this for me! Admittedly, I'm going past simply inserting whatever is pasted into the page. 
I'm doing the extra work because: 1) I actually like to code, and 2) I plan to put it online and make it useful for other UC Davis students.
The website will be sb2cal.com; I've already registered the domain with Google. It does cost me a decent chunk of money, but so would any other hobby (videogames, sports, etc).
